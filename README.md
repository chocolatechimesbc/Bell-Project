## Chocolate Chimes Bell Tower Project

This is our Github website for the Bell Tower Project.

# Background

In 1927, Charles Rogers, founder of Rogers Chocolates, passed away. To honour him, his wife Leah Rogers commissioned a set of Deagon Church chimes to be installed at St. Andrewâ€™s Presbyterian Church. Unfortunately, due to electrical and mechanical failures the chimes had to be disabled in 1965.  We wish to restore functionality to the chimes so that everyone can once again hear their dulcet tones.
